      done, which is not returnable. So basically, all the processing fees,
      payment gateway charges, admin fees, and cost of resources for the work
      done, will be deducted. In short, further, we can’t refund any money which
      is paid to government bodies, such as fees or taxes, or to other third
      parties with a role in processing your order
